### Setup for Chatbot

1. Get a Google Generative AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start both the frontend and API server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
5. Access the chatbot at: http://localhost:5173/chatbot

### API Endpoints

- **Text Chat**: POST to `/api/chat/send` with JSON body `{ "message": "your question", "history": [] }`
- **File Upload**: POST to `/api/chat/send-file` with FormData containing `file` and optional `message`
